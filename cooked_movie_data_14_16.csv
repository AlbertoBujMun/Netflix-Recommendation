Women are burning their bras. The Fonz and Charlies Angels are everywhere. Teens are borrowing the family car to drive to Manhattan with hopes of being picked to enter Studio 54. It is a time of freedom. A time of experimentation. A time where all fantasies can come true - Unfortunately, it is no longer the '70s. How has the ""excitement"" of the 70's turned into the ""blandness"" of today? That is the question that plagues Steve Richards and Eric Meyer in the comedy ""Grownups."" Steve and Eric are average guys living average lives with their average wives in the small suburban town of Freehold, New Jersey. Having been born, raised, and schooled in the Garden State, they are now, in their early 30's, starting to realize that something is lacking in their lives. It's not that their lives are not turning out as expected - it's that they're turning out EXACTLY as expected. Both they and their wives Ami and Claire are dealing with the reality that they are no longer watching MTV, but instead find themselves flipping channels to VH1. They have become grownups. Or at least they are supposed to be. But all four are having trouble dealing with it, and Steve has a job offer in San Francisco. It's something new, something exciting. Yet everybody he knows, everything he has is in Freehold. But maybe that is exactly what he needs. Claire has a great job, great friends, and a great marriage. Moving cross country isn't even a problem for her. But is her lack of problems her problem? Ami, having dropped out of college with twelve credits left, works at a flower shop, biding her time till she can get Eric to understand what she knows deep down what she wants to do - be a mother. In these modern times where phrases like ""two income families"" are the norm, is it wrong for a woman to want to stay home and raise a family? According to Eric and Ami's passive-aggressive mother who refuses to accept that her daughter is an adult, that answer is ""yes"". And finally Eric. Eric has married his high school sweetheart, has a good job, his first house, yet he jokes about all the things he's missed in life. How he's never ridden a motorcycle. And having been with one woman his whole life, he loves to make silly jokes about how he, Ami, Steve, and Claire should ""swap"". After Steve's job opportunity in San Francisco falls through, he comes up with a plan. A plan to do something ""wild."" A once-in-a-lifetime chance to experience the free-thinking lifestyle of the '70s. What if Eric's ""joke"" became ""reality""? ""So you don't mind that you missed Woodstock?"" he asks a reluctant Eric. ""Plato's Retreat? Who'd want to hang out in Hef's grotto with James Caan and three dozen Playmates, when you can grow up with Reaganomics and Rock Hudson's declining health?"" Eric, of course, deep down, wants to do it. But convincing his lifelong friend is just the beginning. How does one ask his wife to try something that breaks so many taboos? And even if the answer is ""yes,"" what then? What about the ramifications? And even if everything goes according to Steve's ""plan,"" is it really enough? Will these four be able to move on with their lives and accept the fact that it's time to start acting their age? And could going through with it destroy their marriages and friendships?"

His first review is for the romantic drama, Message in a Bottle (1999), which tops an unconvincing love story with a contrived and arbitrary ending: thumbs down. He also gives thumbs down to My Favorite Martian (1999), a kiddie film based on the 1960s sitcom that children may like, but adults won't. Next, he discusses the Oscar nominations, paying special note to the surprises, and says that despite Shakespeare in Love (1998) getting more nods than Saving Private Ryan (1998), the latter is still the front-runner for Best Picture. The following segment is about Oscar snubs, in which he lists the titles and names that surprisingly were shut out. Next, he gives thumbs up to Blast from the Past (1999), a charming comedy with Brendan Fraser.

14281,1958.0,A Night to Remember,123,7.9,Roy Ward Baker,Walter Lord-Eric Ambler,The Rank Organisation,Biography-Drama-History,"A successful attempt at an even-handed portrayal of the White Star Line's (later part of Cunard) luxury liner R.M.S. Titanic's sinking from the standpoint of 2nd Officer Charles Herbert Lightoller, himself the most senior of the ill-fated ship's Deck Officers to survive the disaster. (Lightoller later went on to distinguish himself as a line British Naval Officer during the First World War and served as a Senior Naval Staff Officer (convoys) during WWII. Between wars he owned and operated a successful family business producing pleasure craft.) His own survival of the sinking, along with several others, is shown atop one of the liner's two ""collapsible"" lifeboats which was capsized in floating off the liner as it sank. The picture depicts then known facts (c1958) as reported after the sinking; such as the woeful lack of adequate lifeboats, the ship's band playing true to the very end, White Star's co-owner Bruce Ismay's somewhat less than chivalrous departure from the sinking vessel -and- the Titanic's designer (Andrews, on-board) revelation that due to the severity of below-the-water-line damage and that the vaunted watertight compartments were not designed to nor sealed up to the weather deck, would only delay the inevitable as sea water spilled over the top of one to the next from the bows to the stern. It also addresses the mysterious ship seen from the Titanic's bridge stopped some 12-19 miles off and depicts it as being the S.S. Californian, whom - if that steamship had responded, the loss of life could have been far, far less. The Californian is seen stopped due to the ice warnings, the same alerts whose import were undervalued by the Titanic's Captain Smith. She herself had shut-down wireless operations, nominally at 11:00pm as her sole operator retired for the evening, this before the iceberg was struck and the 1st distress calls were made by Titanic. It also addresses somewhat the coal fire in one of Titanic's bunkers - apparently not uncommon back in those days, before her departure into the Atlantic and potential for damage to steel plates below the water line. (This picture predates the calling-into-question of the quality of rivets (metalurgy) which has since come to the fore.) The film also shows the class distinction and its impact as to whom - of the ""women and children first,"" got a seat in a boat; the fact that the first/earliest lifeboats launched were not at full capacity; and that the boats launched from the port and starboard side held to different criteria as to loading. The latter allows the viewer an inference as to the importance for crew and passenger alike as to lifeboat drills which were then (1912) neither required nor ever held aboard Titanic.

The company has yet to produce a film, Bobby's personal net worth is virtually zero, and the company only has $2,184 to its name, $1 invested into it personally by Bobby every week since he first decided he wanted to make a movie when he was a child. Bobby believes his fortunes will change when his accountant Afrim changes hats and writes a science-fiction alien invasion screenplay that Bobby thinks all studios will clamor for and has Oscar written all over it. He has a small stable of followers who support his vision in being part of this movie, which eventually includes Daisy as the lead actress, she a stereotypical small town girl looking to make it big in Hollywood. Having just arrived in town, she does not know her way around the Hollywood system,... except on her proverbial back. Bobby is not averse to telling bald-faced lies in his singular focus in getting the picture made and distributed all on this $2,184 as a starting point. It is using several of those lies that he is able to get a verbal confirmation from big studio executive Jerry Renfro to distribute the movie *if* it stars Kit Ramsey, arguably the biggest action star in the world. Using similar lies, Bobby, however, is unable to convince Kit to star in the movie. Kit, who has a weakness for the Laker Girls, is a self-absorbed and paranoid movie star whose life and thus career is largely directed behind the scenes by Terry Stricter, the head of a new age religion called MindHead. Bobby comes up with a scheme that he believes will get around Kit not agreeing to star: film Kit without him knowing that he is being filmed. The only person who knows of the scheme is Dave, Bobby's lowest of low level inside man turned cinematographer who has unofficial (i.e. technically stolen and thus free) access to studio camera equipment and general knowledge of Kit's general day-to-day movements through the studio system. Bobby is able to convince all the other actors that Kit's acting process involves him not interacting with them outside of filming the specific scenes he has with them. Part of Bobby's scheme involves using Kit's general paranoia that aliens truly are invading the planet to get his gut reactions to what is happening within the context of the script. But Bobby knows he has to get Kit to scream the closing lines of the movie ""gotcha suckas"" for the movie to be a success. Complications ensue when another of the the actors, Carol, tries to go against Bobby's policy of not making contact with Kit outside of filming, and when Bobby is required to hire a production assistant cum stunt double cum acting double, whose job in part is to stand-in for the requisite Kit Ramsey naked ass shot. Through it all, Bobby will know if he has made it in Hollywood if he gets a specific sign specifically from the heavens in the form of FedEx."

Adult Dutch brothers Vincent Van Gogh and Theo Van Gogh, living in Paris, lead differing lives despite having art as a connection. Vincent, who sticks to his principles which includes believing in God but not religion, wants to be a full time painter, living in squalor for his art. Theo, who works in an art gallery, lives for the moment, he selling art which he doesn't much like to lead a comfortable life. One other area of commonality between the brothers is easily succumbing to pleasures of the flesh. Theo does not sell Vincent's art, as he knows it is not in demand. Vincent's view of his brother does not change when he learns it is Theo, and not their father which he had previously thought, who is supporting him. Each brother is a tortured soul - in Vincent's case, it considered in some circles as madness - which affects how each deals with his respective life. Beyond the several sexual relationships each has, some key moments and more extended periods in each their lives over the few years prior to their respective deaths is presented, including: Theo's battle with a bout a syphilis, which affects how and if he can carry on with his sexual relationships; Theo's superiors allowing him to run his own gallery largely on commission, which further pushes him into the realm of selling art he doesn't like to survive; Vincent's period in Provence, where he largely spends with fellow painter Paul Gaugin, one of the few other of his contemporaries he truly admires; and Vincent's infamous self-mutilation of his left ear, leading to Theo's measures to help him over his emotional pain by having him under the care of Dr. Paul Gachet, while dealing with his own turbulent marriage to the former Jo Bonger. That turbulence is largely due to Vincent often being a third in their relationship. This presentation is preceding by showing the acclaim that Vincent is regarded with in current times."

It is at a series of funerals that Harold meets Maude, on the cusp of her eightieth birthday, she who too attends funerals of strangers. Unlike Harold, Maude is obsessed with life - her own life to be more precise - she doing whatever she wants to please herself, damned what others may think or how they may be affected. Since she can't take material possessions with her, she is more interested in experiences, with whatever material possessions she has - often ""borrowed"" without asking - only to further those experiences. Their friendship is initially based on how the other can further their own priority. But as Maude shows Harold how to truly live, Harold falls in love with her. Their relationship, already limited in time by the sheer math, is curtailed even more as Maude shows him only not how to live well, but die well."

Caught in a lie, Sarah is forced to admit to Zora that her husband Charlie, who died before Zora was born and who was the love of her life, is not Zora's biological father as Zora has always believed, but that she was conceived via artificial insemination using anonymous sperm from a sperm bank. Determined to have a man in her life she can truly call a ""Dad"" all her own, Zora, with the help of her longtime best friend Tea Cake Walton, is able to break into the sperm bank's computerized records to find the donor's information, including his name: Hal Jackson. Zora is horrified to learn several things about Hal: that he is *the* Hal Jackson, a local car salesman well known for using tacky methods of advertising; that he is boorish and loutish, stereotypical of his business; but arguably most importantly, that he is Caucasian as in white, white, white, and not even a little black.

The information does make Hal at least examine his life, including two so far failed marriages, and now living with a vacuous and stereotypical blonde named Stacy.

Among the dignitaries from the Balkan State of Carpathia in London for the coronation of King George V and Queen Mary is the Regent, His Serene Highness the Grand Duke Charles. The London foreign office places great importance on Carpathia because of an unstable geopolitical situation with Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany set to overthrow its monarchy government if allowed. The Regent, a Prince originally from Hungary, and the most recent and now deceased Queen married for convenience. As such, the Regent has spent time with a series of lady friends while on his travels in his somewhat ""free"" state. In meeting one of those London women, music hall actress Maisie Springfield, and the company of her current production ""The Coconut Girl"", the Regent instead has his eyes set on one of the minor players in the show, American actress Elsie Marina. When seemingly simpleminded Elsie receives a party invitation from the Regent for that evening, Elsie is not so simpleminded to understand the implications when she learns upon her arrival at the Carpathian Embassy where the Regent and the Carpathian entourage are staying that the party is just for two. On the Regent's relatively short stay in London, he and Elsie go through a series of feelings in their relationship, where the Regent just wants to have some fun, while Elsie doesn't mind fun within a proper context, which means no dinners for two without some formal getting to know each other period. Elsie gets caught up in the diplomatic and geopolitical side of the issues when she inadvertently meets the other two royal members of the Carpathian entourage. The first is the Queen Dowager, the Regent's mother-in-law, who isn't as hard of hearing as she lets on in the carrying out of her duties. The second is Nicholas VIII, the sixteen year old current King and the Regent's son, who will take over official duties when he becomes of age in eighteen months, and who, unlike his father, is sympathetic both to the democratic process in wanting free elections in Carpathia and to the Germans to who he is related on his mother's side. All these goings-on make for a difficult few days for Northbrook, the foreign office's envoy who has just temporarily taken over this file."

To break into the mainstream, the movement needed a powerful voice of prophetic proportions. This voice emerged from the collective work of three pioneering friends from Jamaica, Peter Tosh, Bunny Wailer, and Robert Nesta Marley, who sought to bring about an ideological revolution through deeply meditative, hypnotic, and spiritual music. Catch a Fire was the Wailers' and reggae's introduction to the world and turned Bob Marley into a mega-icon of enormous proportions. It was the first album to remain true to the traditions of reggae music while having enough elements that were accessible to popular culture."

They were originally developed in an era of cheap oil, when the automobile became the center of the way people lived and an era when people wanted to escape the inner city to a more pastoral or rural way of life. However the suburbs quickly evolved into a merely a place to live that had neither the benefits of rural or urban life, and where one was reliant on an automobile both to travel elsewhere and even travel within the neighborhood. The suburbs are not only dependent upon cheap energy, but also reliable energy. The reliability of energy is becoming less so as demonstrated by the multi-day blackout of the North American Eastern Seaboard starting on August 14, 2003. Part of the problem of getting out of the suburban mentality is that a generation has grown up believing it to be a normal way of life, and a life of entitlement, which they will not give up without a fight. But many developers and planners and some of the general public understand the want and need to make the way the collective we live in a more walkable and humanistic manner."

15361,2001.0,Iris,91,7.1,Richard Eyre,John Bayley-Richard Eyre-Charles Wood,British Broadcasting Corporation-Fox Iris Productions-Intermedia Films-Mirage Enterprises-Miramax,Biography-Drama-Romance,"Iris, based on the life of revered British writer and philosopher Iris Murdoch, is a story of unlikely yet enduring love. As a young academic, teaching philosophy at Oxford, Murdoch meets and eventually falls in love with fellow professor John Bayley, a man whose awkwardness seems in stark opposition to the spirited self-confidence of his future wife. The story unfolds as snippets of time, seen through Bayley's eyes. He recalls their first encounter over 40 years ago, activities they enjoyed doing together, and Iris' charismatic and individualistic personality. These images portray Murdoch as a vibrant young woman with great intellect and are contrasted with the novelist's later life, after the effects of Alzheimer's disease have ravaged her. Murdoch's great mind deteriorates until she is reduced to a mere vestige of her former self, unable to perform simple tasks and completely reliant on her at times frustrated yet devoted husband."

The feeling associated with that latter sentiment is strengthened when his mother, Maddy Corrigan, confesses to him that Martin is not his biological father, that person being who was then a law student named Callum Crane with who she had a one time liaison and who she never told about the pregnancy. Nathan decides to search for Callum. Meanwhile, Callum is now married and a high powered lawyer, whose colleagues in the know consider amoral and devious. Just before he is appointed a federal judge, Callum rapes Sophie Lennon, a secretary new to the law firm where he works. Because of that situation, Callum has Sophie fired. Feeling otherwise helpless in the situation, Sophie threatens to expose what Callum did unless he gives up his judgeship, she unable to stomach the thought that he would be overseeing rape cases. Based on the event surrounding their auspicious initial meeting, Callum, who wants Sophie just to go away, ends up asking Nathan to kill her, not knowing that his and Nathan's encounter was not by chance and that he is Nathan's biological father. Callum hands Nathan a sealed envelope with a $5,000 retainer and the identity of the person he wants killed, the remaining $25,000 payment only if the hit is carried out. Nathan decides not even to open the envelope.

Radha (Nargis), as the mother of the village, is asked to open the canal and remembers back to her past when she was newly married, mirroring the new independence of India. The wedding between Radha and Shamu (Raaj Kumar) was paid for by Radha's mother-in-law, who got a loan from the moneylender Sukhilala. This event starts the spiral of poverty and hardship that Radha endures. The conditions of the loan are disputed, but the village elders decide in favor of the moneylender, after which Shamu and Radha are forced to pay three-quarters of their crop as interest on the loan of 500 rupees. While trying to use more of their land to alleviate their poverty, Shamu's arms are crushed by a boulder. He is shamed by his helplessness and is humiliated by others in the village. Deciding that he is no use to his family, he leaves and does not return. Soon after this, Radha's mother-in-law dies. Radha continues to work in the fields with her children and gives birth again. Sukhilala offers to help alleviate her poverty in return for Radha marrying him, but she refuses to sell herself. A storm sweeps through the village that destroys the harvest and kills Radha's youngest child, and the villagers start to migrate but decide to stay and rebuild because of Radha's urging. The film then skips forward several years to when Radha's two surviving children, Birju (Sunil Dutt) and Ramu (Rajendra Kumar), are young men. Birju, embittered by the exactions of Sukhilala since he was a child, takes out his frustrations by pestering the village girls, especially Sukhilala's daughter.

The first 7 shorts are part of the segment called Mysterious Phenomena of the Unexplained, which is the name of Daffy's skeptical show about the paranormal unexplained phenomena that people have reported. In Sufferin' Sasquatch, Sylvester's family spends their vacation camping in the woods, but are they alone? In Who Wants To Be A Martianaire?, Elmer Fudd is abducted to be the involuntary contestant in an alien quiz show hosted by Marvin the Martian. In Loch Ness Mess, Daffy and quite Scottish Yosemite Sam try to find the Loch Ness Monster. In Cropsy Curvy, Elmer Fudd suspect that a UFO might have landed in his cornfield, but it's just Bugs stealing his pie. Or is it? In The Bermuda Short, Sylvester, Tweety and Granny are on a luxury cruise - in the middle of Bermuda Triangle! In The Taming of the Screwball, Daffy, Porky and Taz try to perform a play terribly, as part of a financial swindle, in a theater haunted by a ghost. In El Chupacabra!, Daffy's latest paranormal investigation that he's turned into unofficial beach vacation is interrupted by Porky's warnings that something isn't quite right with the locale. The next five shorts are set in a luxury hotel, Royal Mallard, that Daffy frequents. In Gone In 30 Minutes, Daffy does his best to stop Porky from delivering his pizza to him, since Porky's business policy is - pizza delivered under 30 minutes or it's free. In Window Pains, window cleaners Foghorn Leghorn and Barnyard Dawg develop an unhealthy competition while cleaning the hotel's windows. In Daffy's Meet Market, Daffy decides to visit the gym to impress a girl. In Cube Wars, Elmer Fudd, whose job is on the line, is trying to work in his cubical, when two co-workers - Daffy and Bugs make a living hell out of his workday. In Hogs & Kisses, Porky takes his girlfriend to a refined French restaurant, but she's not very pleased with the food that's on the menu. The next four shorts are single entries and are not part of any segment. In Satellite Sam, Bugs home is jeopardized by Yosemite Sam's construction work. In Tech Suppork, Porky is having problems with his office computer, so he calls tech support, which turns out to be bored Taz, for help. In Twick Or Tweety, Sylvester once again goes after Tweety, who's now owned by Witch Hazel, and finally eats the poor little yellow bird, but then lives to regret it. In The Island of Dr. Moron, Bugs spoils the latest experiment of a mad scientist, who's just created a carrot no rabbit will eat. He sends Gossamer and a similar orange monster to get Bugs, but everything ends with a surprise wedding. The final three shorts are part of Planet of the Taz segment, a parody of Planet of the Apes, starring Daffy as Duck Dodgers and Porky as his faithful sidekick. In Planet of the Taz, Dodgers returns to the planet where he lives after flying through a strange wormhole, only to find things a lot different then before. In Beneath the Planet of Taz, Dodgers and Porky are captured along with Charlton Heston's character by the Taz, but escape and find the ultimately disappointing forgotten lost superweapon of a bygone civilization. In Enough with the Planet of the Taz, Dodgers and Porky finally come up with a plan to escape the planet, but the story ends with a surprise twist, that's slightly different than the one from the Planet of the Apes franchise."

In continuing their investigation, one of the lead scientists, a Frenchman named Claude Lacombe, incorporates the Kodály method of music education as a means of communication in their work. The response, in turn, at first baffles the researchers, until American cartographer David Laughlin deciphers the meaning of the response. In the second, electric company lineman and family man Roy Neary and single mother Jillian Guiler are among some individuals in Muncie, Indiana who experience some paranormal activity before some flashes of bright lights in the sky, which they believe to be a UFO. Roy becomes obsessed with what he saw, unlike some others, especially in some form of authority, who refuse to acknowledge their belief that it was a UFO in not wanting to appear crazy. That obsession both for Roy and Jillian is ratcheted up a notch when they begin to have a vision of a mound with vertical striations on its side as a key to what is going on. While the obsession negatively affects Roy's life as he knows it in its entirety, Jillian knows she has to find the answer as to its meaning, especially as it relates to her only child, three year old Barry Guiler, who may be more attuned to what is happening than the adult figures around him. These two stories have the potential to intersect if Roy and Jillian can discover where they've seen that mound before, and if they can overcome what they believe to be the lies perpetrated by those in authority in covering up what is going on."

15933,1997.0,A Life Apart: Hasidism in America,96,6.8,Menachem Daum-Oren Rudavsky,Menachem Daum-Robert Seidman,Oren Rudavsky Productions,Documentary,"Hasidic Jews seem alien, and even hostile, to those outside their culture,which frequently includes other Jews. They dress differently, don't mingle between the sexes, speak Yiddish, and wear side curls, all in an attempt to rigorously follow the commandments of the Torah. They tend to keep to themselves, shunning television and the media so outside influences cannot corrupt their values and views. Yet filmmakers Oren Rudavsky and Menachem Daum were able to enter their world, and the result is the fascinating documentary A Life Apart: Hasidism in America. Using interviews with academics and members of the community and some historical footage, the filmmakers trace the growth of Hasidic groups in the United States. Groups formed around particular Rebbes (learned leaders) and they took their names from their Eastern European home cities (the Satmar Hasids, the Breslov Hasids, and so on). Leonard Nimoy and Sarah Jessica Parker narrate, explaining how this movement came to America and how it was able to flourish. Dissenting voices also appear, in the form of neighborhood people who are distressed at the Hasids' refusal to speak to members not in their community and of a young woman, Pearl Gluck, who left the community in order to pursue her writing and to follow a life of her own choosing. Many Hasids refuse to speak on camera, and we see many shielding themselves with hands or coats so as not to appear on film. But those who do appear are poignant in their discussions of why the Hasidic life is important to them. One man speaks to the directors, even as he acknowledges that he will never see the movie, but he will do it ""in order to help a Jew make a living."" One couple, Holocaust survivors, are not Hasidic, but their children are, and the reasonings of both the parents and the children are interesting. This film, shown on PBS, is a consequential look into a lifestyle many of us don't understand, and it may help in increasing an understanding."
